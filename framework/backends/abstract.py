    This class provides an abstract ancestor for classes implementing backends,
    providing a light public API. The goal of this API is to be "just enough",
    not a generic writing solution. To that end it provides two public methods,
    'finalize', and 'write_test'. These two methods are designed to be just
    enough to write a backend without needing format specific options.

    Any locking that is necessary should be done in the child classes, as not
    all potential backends need locking (for example, a SQL based backend might
    be thread safe and not need to be locked during write)

        The backend storage container should be created and made ready to write
        into in the constructor, along with any other setup.

        This method also write any initial metadata as appropriate. No backend
        is required to write all metadata, but each should write as much as
        possible.

        In addition it takes keyword arguments that define options for the
        backends. options should be prefixed to identify which backends they
        apply to. For example, a json specific value should be passed as
        json_*, while a file specific value should be passed as file_*)

        Arguments:
        dest -- the place to write the results to. This should be correctly
                handled based on the backend, the example is calls open() on a
                file, but other backends might want different options

        metadata is not required, and Backend derived classes need to handle
        being passed None correctly.
