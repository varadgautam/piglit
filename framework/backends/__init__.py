"""Provides a module like interface for backends.

This package provides an abstract interface for working with backends, which
implement various functions as provided in the Registry class, and then provide
a Registry instance as REGISTRY, which maps individual objects to objects that
piglit expects to use. This module then provides a thin abstraction layer so
that piglit is never aware of what backend it's using, it just asks for an
object and receives one.

Most consumers will want to import framework.backends and work directly with
the helper functions here. For some more detailed uses (test cases expecially)
the modules themselves may be used.

When this module is loaded it will search through framework/backends for python
modules (those ending in .py), and attempt to import them. Then it will look
for an attribute REGISTRY in those modules, and if it as a
framework.register.Registry instance, it will add the name of that module (sans
.py) as a key, and the instance as a value to the BACKENDS dictionary. Each of
the helper functions in this module uses that dictionary to find the function
that a user actually wants.
