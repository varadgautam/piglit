    Nose uses python generators to create test generators, the drawback of this
    is that unless the generator is very specifically engineered it yeilds the
    same instance multiple times. Since nose uses an instance attribute to
    display the name of the test on a failure, and it prints the failure
    dialogue after the run is complete all failing tests from a single
    generator will end up with the name of the last test generated. This
    generator is used in conjunction with the nose_generator() decorator to
    create multiple objects each with a unique description attribute, working
    around the bug.
    Upstream bug: https://code.google.com/p/python-nose/issues/detail?id=244
