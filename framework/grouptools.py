"""Module providing utility functions to work with piglit groups.

Instead of using posixpath (or the generic os.path) for working with tests this
module should be prefered.

Piglit groups look much like posix paths, they are '/' delimited with each
element representing a group, and the final element being the test name. Unlike
posix paths they may not start with a leading '/'.
