/**
 * \file map-invalidate-range.c
 * Try to exercise some corner cases of range mapping with alignment guarantees.
 *
 * Under certain circumstances, many OpenGL implementations will
 * allocate temporary storage for a mapping of a buffer object.  This
 * most commonly occurs when:
 *
 * 1. The buffer being mapped is being accessed by the GPU.
 * 2. The buffer is being mapped write-only.
 * 3. The range is mapped with invalidate (via \c GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_RANGE_BIT).
 *
 * Furthermore, at least some driver make different choices about the
 * allocation of the temporary storage depending on whether or not
 * explicit flushed (via \c GL_MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT_BIT) is requested.
 *
 * This test tries to make sure the temporary storage allocated for
 * the mapping still provides the alignment guarantees required by
 * GL_ARB_map_buffer_alignment.  This is accomplished by starting some
 * rendering that will use the entire buffer then immediately trying
 * to map some portion of the buffer.
