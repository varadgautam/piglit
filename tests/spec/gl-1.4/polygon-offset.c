/** @file polygon-offset.c
 *
 * Implementation of polygon offset tests.
 *
 * This test verifies glPolygonOffset.  It is run on every
 * OpenGL-capable drawing surface configuration that supports
 * creation of a window, has a depth buffer, and is RGB.
 * 
 * The first subtest verifies that the OpenGL implementation is
 * using a plausible value for the \"minimum resolvable
 * difference\" (MRD).  This is the offset in window coordinates
 * that is sufficient to provide separation in depth (Z) for any
 * two parallel surfaces.  The subtest searches for the MRD by
 * drawing two surfaces at a distance from each other and
 * checking the resulting image to see if they were cleanly
 * separated.  The distance is then modified (using a binary
 * search) until a minimum value is found.  This is the so-called
 * \"ideal\" MRD.  Then two surfaces are drawn using
 * glPolygonOffset to produce a separation that should equal one
 * MRD.  The depth values at corresponding points on each surface
 * are subtracted to form the \"actual\" MRD.  The subtest performs
 * these checks twice, once close to the viewpoint and once far
 * away from it, and passes if the largest of the ideal MRDs and
 * the largest of the actual MRDs are nearly the same.
 * 
 * The second subtest verifies that the OpenGL implementation is
 * producing plausible values for slope-dependent offsets.  The
 * OpenGL spec requires that the depth slope of a surface be
 * computed by an approximation that is at least as large as
 * max(abs(dz/dx),abs(dz/dy)) and no larger than
 * sqrt((dz/dx)**2+(dz/dy)**2).  The subtest draws a quad rotated
 * by various angles along various axes, samples three points on
 * the quad's surface, and computes dz/dx and dz/dy.  Then it
 * draws two additional quads offset by one and two times the
 * depth slope, respectively.  The base quad and the two new
 * quads are sampled and their actual depths read from the depth
 * buffer.  The subtest passes if the quads are offset by amounts
 * that are within one and two times the allowable range,
 * respectively.
 *
 * Derived in part from tests written by Angus Dorbie <dorbie@sgi.com>
 * in September 2000 and Rickard E. (Rik) Faith <faith@valinux.com> in
 * October 2000.

 * Ported to Piglit by Laura Ekstrand.

	 * MRD stands for Minimum Resolvable Difference, the smallest
	 * distance in depth that suffices to separate any two
	 * polygons (or a polygon and the near or far clipping
	 * planes).
	 *
	 * This function tries to determine the "ideal" MRD for the
	 * current rendering context.  It's expressed in window
	 * coordinates, because the value in model or clipping
	 * coordinates depends on the scale factors in the modelview
	 * and projection matrices and on the distances to the near
	 * and far clipping planes.
	 *
	 * For simple unsigned-integer depth buffers that aren't too
	 * deep (so that precision isn't an issue during coordinate
	 * transformations), it should be about one least-significant
	 * bit.  For deep or floating-point or compressed depth
	 * buffers the situation may be more complicated, so we don't
	 * pass or fail an implementation solely on the basis of its
	 * ideal MRD.
	 *
	 * There are two subtle parts of this function.  The first is
	 * the projection matrix we use for rendering.  This matrix
	 * places the far clip plane at infinity (so that we don't run
	 * into arbitrary limits during our search process).  The
	 * second is the method used for drawing the polygon.  We
	 * scale the x and y coords of the polygon vertices by the
	 * polygon's depth, so that it always occupies the full view
	 * frustum.  This makes it easier to verify that the polygon
	 * was resolved completely -- we just read back the entire
	 * window and see if any background pixels appear.
	 *
	 * To insure that we get reasonable results on machines with
	 * unusual depth buffers (floating-point, or compressed), we
	 * determine the MRD twice, once close to the near clipping
	 * plane and once as far away from the eye as possible.  On a
	 * simple integer depth buffer these two values should be
	 * essentially the same.  For other depth-buffer formats, the
	 * ideal MRD is simply the largest of the two.
