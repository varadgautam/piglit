/**
 * \file active-sampler-conflict.c
 * Verify results of program pipeline validation when a conflicting sampler
 * configuration is used.
 *
 * Section 2.11.11 (Shader Execution), subheading "Validation," of the OpenGL
 * 4.1 spec says:
 *
 *     "[INVALID_OPERATION] is generated by any command that transfers
 *     vertices to the GL if:
 *
 *         ...
 *
 *         - Any two active samplers in the current program object are of
 *           different types, but refer to the same texture image unit."
 *
 * This test verifies this behavior several ways.  First, an invalid
 * configuration is constructed.  When the pipeline is in the invalid
 * configuration, glValidateProgramPipeline is used to determine the status.
 *
 * The pipeline is then transitioned to a valid configuration, and
 * glValidateProgramPipeline is called again.
 *
 * The pipeline is then transitioned back to the invalid configuration.
 * Without calling glValidateProgramPipeline, glDrawArrays is called.  This
 * should generate the aforementioned error.  While still in the invalid state
 * glValidateProgramPipeline is called a third time.
 *
 * Finally, the pipeline is transitioned back to the valid configuration.
 * Without calling glValidateProgramPipeline, glDrawArrays is called.  This
 * should not generate any error.
 *
 * All of the state flip-flopping is done in an attempt to catch
 * implementations that latch state in glValidateProgramPipeline and do not
 * re-validate in glDrawArrays.
