/**
 * @file fs-discard-exit-2.c
 *
 * Tests that the discard keyword stops all further execution on that channel.
 *
 * From the GLSL 1.30 spec revision 9:
 *
 *     "Control flow exits the shader, and subsequent implicit or
 *      explicit derivatives are undefined when this control flow is
 *      non-uniform (meaning different fragments within the primitive
 *      take different control paths)."
 *
 * Here's the testing plan: Divide the 64x64 window into an 8x8 grid.
 * For each grid entry, choose a unique pixel to discard, and then run
 * a loop that would infinite loop on that pixel.  This should get at
 * the intent of the spec and a bug in my first implementation of the
 * fix on i965, while also improving our coverage of pixel discard
 * (which previously tended to discard big regions that were at least
 * 2x2 subspan aligned).
