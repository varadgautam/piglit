/**
 * \file double_in_bool_uniform.c
 *
 * Tests that glUniform works as specified for trying to using the double
 * interfaces with a bool uniform.
 *
 * The GL_ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 specification says in the Issues section:
 * "(15) Can the 64-bit uniform APIs be used to load values for uniforms of
 *       type "bool", "bvec2", "bvec3", or "bvec4"?
 *    RESOLVED:  No.  OpenGL 2.0 and beyond did allow "bool" variable to be
 *    set with Uniform*i* and Uniform*f APIs, and OpenGL 3.0 extended that
 *    support to Uniform*ui* for orthogonality.  But it seems pointless to
 *    extended this capability forward to 64-bit Uniform APIs as well."
