/**
 * \file loc-boundaries.c
 *
 * Tests the boundary values for uniform locations, this is a positive test
 * for the locations, every check here is expected to pass.
 *
 * The GL_ARB_explicit_uniform_location spec says:
 *     "The explicitly defined locations and the generated locations must be
 *     in the range of 0 to MAX_UNIFORM_LOCATIONS minus one."
 *
 *     "Valid locations for default-block uniform variable locations are in
 *     the range of 0 to the implementation-defined maximum number of
 *     uniform locations."
 *
 * This test tests 0, MAX - 1 and a single value in between, shader contains
 * also uniform without explicit location to see that it does not affect
 * getting the wanted locations.
