/**
 * @file vao-broken-attrib.c
 *
 * Tests that in the core profile, drawing with a vertex attrib enabled but not
 * sourced from a buffer does not crash the driver. Exercises a bug in i965.
 *
 * The GL 4.5 spec says:
 *	"If any enabled arrayâ€™s buffer binding is zero when DrawArrays or
 *	one of the other drawing commands defined in section 10.4 is called,
 *	the result is undefined.""
 *
 * Note that this crash is reasonable (but unfortunate) in versions of GL which
 * permit vertex attributes to be sourced from client memory.
