# From the GL_ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object spec:

#   "The compiler/linker will ensure that multiple programs and
#    programmable stages containing this definition will share the same memory
#    layout for this block, as long as all arrays are declared with explicit
#    sizes and all matrices have matching row_major and/or column_major
#    qualifications (which may come from a declaration outside the block
#    definition)"
