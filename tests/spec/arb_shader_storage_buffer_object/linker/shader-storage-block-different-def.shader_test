# From the GL_ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object spec:
#
#  "If multiple shaders are linked together, then they will share a single
#   global buffer variable name space, including within a language as well as
#   across languages.  Hence, the types of buffer variables with the same name
#   must match across all shaders that are linked into a single program.
