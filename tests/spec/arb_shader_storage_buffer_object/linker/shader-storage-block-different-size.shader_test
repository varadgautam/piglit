# From the GL_ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object spec:
#
#  "When a named shader storage block is declared by multiple shaders in a
#   program, it must be declared identically in each shader. The buffer
#   variables within the block must be declared with the same names, types,
#   qualification, and declaration order.  If a program contains multiple
#   shaders with different declarations for the same named shader storage
#   block, the program will fail to link.
