/**
 * \file
 *
 * This test makes current a context, terminates the context's display, then
 * unbinds the context. According to the EGL 1.4 spec (2011.04.06), Section
 * 3.2 Initialization, no error should occur.
 *
 *     EGLBoolean eglTerminate(EGLDisplay dpy);
 *
 *     Termination marks all EGL-specific resources, such as contexts and
 *     surfaces, associated with the specified display for deletion. Handles
 *     to all such resources are invalid as soon as eglTerminate returns, but
 *     the dpy handle itself remains valid. [...] Applications should not try
 *     to perform useful work with such resources following eglTerminate; only
 *     eglMakeCurrent or eglReleaseThread should be called, to complete
 *     deletion of these resources.
 *
 *     If contexts or surfaces created with respect to dpy are current (see
 *     section 3.7.3) to any thread, then they are not actually destroyed
 *     while they remain current. Such contexts and surfaces will be destroyed
 *     as soon as eglReleaseThread is called from the thread they are bound
 *     to, or eglMakeCurrent is called from that thread with the current
 *     rendering API (see section 3.7) set such that the current context is
 *     affected. [...]
