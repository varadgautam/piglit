"""Generate Interpopation tests.

Correct interpolation of vertex shader outputs depends on (a)
whether an interpolation qualifier is present in the shader source,
and if so which qualifier is used, (b) if no interpolation qualifier
is present, whether the output is a user-defined variable or a
built-in color, and (c) if the output is a built-in color, the
setting of the ShadeModel() setting.  In addition, we would like to
test correct interpolation under various clipping scenarios.

To verify that all the combinations of these possibilities work
correctly, this script generates a shader_runner test to check
proper interpolation for every combination of the following
variables:

- which interpolation qualifier is used ("flat", "noperspective",
  "smooth", or no qualifier)

- which variable is used (gl_FrontColor, gl_BackColor,
  gl_FrontSecondaryColor, gl_BackSecondaryColor, or a non-built-in
  variable)

- the setting of ShadeModel() (either GL_SMOOTH or GL_FLAT)

- whether the triangle in question is clipped using gl_ClipVertex,
  clipped using gl_ClipDistance, clipped against the fixed viewing
  volume, or unclipped.

The tests operate by drawing a triangle with a different value of
the variable at each vertex, and then probing within the interior of
the triangle to verify that interpolation was performed correctly.
The triangle is drawn in a frustum projection, with a different z
value for each vertex, so that there will be a detectable difference
in behavior between noperspective and smooth interpolation.

When testing clipping, we clip off the frontmost corner of the
triangle; this ensures that the proportion of the triangle's screen
real estate that is clipped is significantly larger than the
proportion of the triangle's 3D coordinate space that is clipped.
So if the GL implementation doesn't perform perspective-correct
interpolation generating clipped vertices, we will notice.

This program outputs, to stdout, the name of each file it generates.

        'vertex' to test a triangle which has one corner clipped using
